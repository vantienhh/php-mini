## Intro

A mini PHP framework built from scratch following the latest PSR standards.

The framework includes concepts like:

### Routing

`routes.php`

You can make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or any HTTP route.

```php
// GET
$app->get('users', ['UsersController', 'index']);

// POST
$app->post('users', ['UsersController', 'store']);
```

### Responses

You can return HTML views, JSON, or any other content type either from Controllers or by using anonymoues functions.

```php
# return html view
$app->get('/', ['PagesController', 'home']);

# return json
$app->get('users', ['UsersController', 'index']);

# return plain text
$app->get('status', function ($app) {
	return '<pre> I\'m OK </pre>';
});
```

### Container

The app container file is located at `app/Core/Container.php`.

You can bind items to the app within `bootstrap/app.php` using the following array syntax.

```php
$app->bind('databaseConnection', [new App\Core\Database\Connection, 'make']);
```

The first item in the array is the instance of the class you want to bind and the second is the method to invoke.

And to simply resolve items out of the container:

```php
$db = $app->databaseConnection;
```

### Dependency Injection

Checkout `app/Core/App.php` and `app/Core/Database/Connection.php` to understand that the container object is automatically injected into its bindings. Here the binding is `databaseConnection`.

```php
class Connection
{
	/*
	 * App\Core\Container $container is injected 
	 * automatically by $app (bind)
	 */
    public function make($container)
    {
    	//
    }
}
```

The following code within `app/Core/Database/QueryBuilder.php` shows that we're injecting the PDO dependency into the `Connection` class.

```php
public function __construct(PDO $connection)
{
    $this->connection = $connection;
}
```

### Closures

Apart from the array syntax, you can also bind items to the app by passing a closure as the second argument, within `bootstrap/app.php`

```php
$app->bind('database', function ($app) {
	return new App\Core\Database\QueryBuilder($app->databaseConnection);
});
```

### And more
The framework includes many other concepts like MVC, front-controller pattern, collections, models, custom config file, etc.

## Installation

Simply clone and install by:

`composer install`

And bootup the server by running:

`php -S localhost:8080 -t public/`

> Note that the framework is not to be used for real projects.
> Built to understand the inner workings of popular frameworks in a simplistic way!
